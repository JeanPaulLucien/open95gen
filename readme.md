<h1>Open95Keygen</h1> 
<p>by Alex Free</p>

<p>Open95Keygen is a portable open source program that generates random valid Product Keys (both OEM and Retail types) for Microsoft's Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 operating systems.</p>

<p>The Windows 95/NT 4.0 OEM/Retail Product Key algorithms have been reverse engineered by many people. Open95Keygen is a <b><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design>clean room design</a></b> implementation not based on any existing software, it is written based on the specifications of the algorithm which is <b>inherently not copyright infringement</b>. I was inspired to write Open95Keygen after watching the YouTuber <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3S8vxwRfqLBdIhgRlDRVzw>stack smashing's</a> video <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwyH59nACzQ>Why 111-1111111 is a valid Windows 95 key</a>.</p>

<a name=compat><h2>Supported Operating Systems</h2></a>

<p>The win32 release works on Windows 95 and newer (requires Internet Explorer 4.0 installed if using Windows 95).</p>
<p>The Linux releases for x86 32 bit and x86_64 64 bit are static executables meaning they should work on most modern distros. If the Linux versions provided does not work for you, please compile from <a href="#install_source">source</a>.</p>
<p>The Mac OS 8 release works on Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9 on both PowerPC and 68K Macs.</p>
<p>The Mac OS X release works on PowerPC Mac OS X 10.3.9-10.6.8. Intel Macs should be able to use this release on Mac OS X 10.4-10.6.8 provided that the Rosetta software is installed. If you want to use Open95Keygen on Mac OS X 10.7+ or some other operating system, please compile Open95Keygen from <a href="#install_source">source</a>.</p> 

<a name=usage><h2>Usage</h2></a>

<p>First, <a href="#downloads">download</a> the right release for your operating system, or compile Open95Keygen from <a href="#install_source">source</a>.</p>
<p>This is a command line program, so on Windows you first must open the <code>command.com</code> or <code>cmd.exe</code> program. Then just drag o95kg.exe into the <code>command.com</code> or <code>cmd.exe</code> window and press the <code>enter</code> or <code>return</code> key.</p>

<p>On Mac OS 8, Mac OS 9, or Mac OS X just double click the <code>o95kg</code> file.</p>

<p>On Linux, you may be able to just double click the <code>o95kg</code> file to start Open95Keygen. If this does not work, start your terminal program and execute <code>o95kg</code>.</p>

<p>On Windows 95/NT 4.0, if you see the word OEM in between where you enter the Product Key, use the generated OEM Product Key. If you do not see the word OEM when asked to enter a Product Key, use the generated Retail Product Key.</p>

<p>Version 1.0 - 2/7/2021</p>
<ul><li>First release.</li></ul>

<a name=install_source><h2>Install From Source</h2></a>

<p>This software is written to run on any ANSI-C platform. Really, this software is as easy to compile as <code>gcc o95kg.c -o o95kg</code>. A GNU Makefile is provided in the source <a href=https://github.com/alex-free/open95keygen/archive/1.0.zip>download</a> (N/A to classic Mac OS 8-9, you'll need to generate your own build commands with <a href=https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/macintosh-programmers-workshop>Macintosh Programmer's Workshop</a>) that will do just that by default, when executing <code>make</code>. There are some additional rules to make various tasks easier to accomplish, which are listed below.</p>

<p>Compile for Mac OS X 10.3.9+ PowerPC.<p>
<code>make mac-ppc</code> 

<p>Compile a static 32 bit Linux build.<p>
<code>make linux-static32</code> 

<p>Compile a static 64 bit Linux build.<p>
<code>make linux-static64</code>

<p>Cross compile using the i686-w64-mingw32-gcc compiler for Windows 95 and above (requires Internet Explorer 4.0 to be installed if running on Windows 95).</p>
<code>make cross-win32</code>
